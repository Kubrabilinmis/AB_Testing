## Business Problem :
A commany has recently introduced a new type of bidding, the average bidding, as an alternative to the bid given to the current maximum bidding.
One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to do an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding.
